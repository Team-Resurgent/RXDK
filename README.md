# RXDK: Modern Development for the Original Xbox

**RXDK**: is a community-driven project that enables developers to build software for the Original Xbox using modern Windows operating systems like Windows 10 and 11, as well as newer versions of Visual Studio starting from 2019. Traditionally, developing for the Original Xbox required a Windows XP environment (often via a virtual machine), Visual Studio 2003 .NET, and the official Xbox Development Kit (XDK) installer. RXDK eliminates these limitations by providing an open-source installer that integrates the XDK with modern development environments.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Modern Development Environment**: Compile Xbox applications using Visual Studio 2019 and beyond.
- **Simplified Installation**: Automates the setup process for the XDK on modern Windows platforms.
- **Open Source**: Developed collaboratively by the Xbox-scene community.
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Eliminates the need for legacy systems like Windows XP and Visual Studio 2003 .NET.
- **Existing Tools Support**: Adds Support and work arounds for debugging tools such as Xbox Watson Etc
---

## üöß Limitations and Disclaimer

Please note the following limitations and important information:

- **Debugging Not Yet Supported**: Features such as adding breakpoints and debugging through Visual Studio are not currently functional.
- **No Deployment via Visual Studio**: File transfer to the Xbox cannot be done using the Visual Studio deploy option. Instead, you will need to manually transfer files to your Xbox or use an emulator such as **Xemu** for testing.
- **XDKSetup5849.17 Recommended**: The **official XDKSetup** is not included with this tool. Users must provide their own copy of the installer. Other versions of XDKSetup may work but have not been thoroughly tested. This example was tested specifically with version 5849.17.
- **Disclaimer**: We cannot and will not be held liable for where or how you obtain the XDKSetup installer. Additionally, we will not provide further instructions on obtaining it.
- **Early Development Stage**: RXDK is in its early stages and may contain bugs or missing features. Community contributions are encouraged to enhance its functionality and stability.
